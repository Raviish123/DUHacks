<b>How it works-</b>
<ul>
<li>Users have the option to register as either "poolers" or "drivers." </li>
<li>Poolers can request rides by entering their pickup and dropoff locations. </li>
<li>Any registered driver who is travelling that route for their own employment may accept a pooler along the way and provide a lift.</li>
<li>Using any Unified Payments Interface, poolers can pay drivers after dropping them off (UPI). The cost of a ride is extremely low, starting at just Rs. 20 for the initial booking fee and rising to Rs. 10 for each additional km. These prices are less expensive than what Indians must pay for taxis. (Payment Interface not implemented)</li>
<li>Points are also given to the poolers after they reach a certain number of rides and when they view commercials. These points can then be redeemed for discounts on subsequent rides. (Future plan, not implemented)</li>
<li>Each user is required to provide and verify a government-approved form of identification when joining the platform in order to ensure the safety and trust of both poolers and drivers. (Future plan, not implemented)</li>
<li>Depending on their demands, poolers can choose to work as drivers from their profile and vice versa.</li>
</ul>
